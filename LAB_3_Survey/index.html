	            	<p>The Search Images website aims to present relevant images to the user. Thus, three search methods are available:</p>
	            	<br>
	            	<ul>
	            		<li>Search by category</li>
	            		<li>Color search</li>
	            		<li>Search for similar image</li>
	            	</ul>
	            	<br>
	            	<p>The user can search for the most relevant images of a certain category, can search for images with more percentage of a color, and also can search for images more similar to an image entered by the user.</p>
	            	<br>
	            	<p>This questionnaire is designed to evaluate the usability of the website. We ask you to complete the tasks described below and, by completing this questionnaire, tell us about the difficulties you encountered in interacting with the system and give us your opinion about the interface and the available features.</p>
	            	<br>
	            	<p>Thank you for your participation!</p>
